# KunstlicheIntelligenz-Deep-Learning-for-Begineers

Welcome to this repository dedicated to sharing deep learning projects with the community. The main goal here is to educate and hopefully inspire budding AI enthusiasts to dive into the fascinating world of deep learning. I've curated a collection of projects ranging from the very basics to more advanced topics, all implemented with the TensorFlow framework.

## Project List

1. **Linear Regression:** Understand the foundation of most machine learning algorithms with regression projects.

2. **Logistic Regression:** Explore a more advanced type of regression used for classification problems.

3. **Image Classification:** Delve into Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with a project that identifies different types of image classes.

4. **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** We'll use deep learning models to predict next words in a sentence, sentiment analysis, and more.

5. **Time Series Analysis:** This project deals with predicting future values based on previously observed values.
